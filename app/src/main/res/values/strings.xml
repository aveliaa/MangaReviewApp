        "Berserk" is a dark fantasy manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. The story follows the journey of Guts, a mercenary warrior, as he battles demons and other supernatural foes while seeking revenge against his former friend and rival, Griffith.
        One of the strengths of "Berserk" is its rich and detailed world-building. Miura has created a complex and immersive world, with its own mythology, history, and political factions. The manga also features a wide range of interesting and well-developed characters, from Guts and Griffith to the members of Guts band of mercenaries. \n\n

        Another highlight of "Berserk" is its visceral and graphic violence. The manga does not shy away from depicting gore and brutality, and this serves to reinforce the harsh and unforgiving nature of the world that Guts inhabits. Additionally, the action scenes are well choreographed and exciting, with a strong sense of momentum and impact. \n\n

        The artwork in "Berserk" is also noteworthy. Miuras style is highly detailed and intricate, with a focus on fine linework and shading. The character designs are distinctive and memorable, with a particular emphasis on Guts imposing and intimidating appearance.
        However, it should be noted that "Berserk" is a mature and intense manga, with themes of violence, trauma, and sexual assault. The manga is not recommended for younger or more sensitive readers. \n\n

        Overall, "Berserk" is a well-crafted and immersive manga series that will appeal to readers who enjoy dark fantasy and action-packed storytelling. However, it should be approached with caution due to its mature content. Additionally, it should be noted that the manga is unfinished, with the last chapter published in 2018 before Miuras unexpected death. \n\n

        "Denjin N" is a manga series written and illustrated by Masakazu Katsura. Unfortunately, while the series has some interesting ideas, it falls short in execution and ultimately feels underdeveloped and unsatisfying.\n\n

        One of the main issues with "Denjin N" is its weak and convoluted plot. The story follows a high school student who gains the ability to transform into a powerful cyborg named Denjin N. However, the manga struggles to find a cohesive narrative, jumping from one plot point to another without fully exploring or developing them. The result is a story that feels rushed and disjointed, with many unresolved plot threads and confusing twists that leave the reader feeling unsatisfied.\n\n

        Additionally, the characters in "Denjin N" are largely forgettable and underdeveloped. The protagonist lacks personality and depth, and the supporting characters are similarly one-dimensional and lacking in complexity. The relationships between the characters feel forced and artificial, with little emotional resonance or investment.\n\n

        The artwork in "Denjin N" is also disappointing. While Katsuras style is clean and attractive, the character designs are generic and uninspired. The action scenes lack impact and excitement, and the overall visual presentation feels dated and lacking in creativity.\n\n

        Overall, "Denjin N" is a disappointing manga series that fails to live up to its potential. The weak and convoluted plot, underdeveloped characters, and lackluster artwork make for an unsatisfying reading experience. While the manga may have some interesting ideas, it ultimately falls short in execution and fails to leave a lasting impression.\n\n

        "Dokumushi" is a manga series written and illustrated by Megumi Toda. The story follows a young woman named Rui who becomes entangled in a mysterious and dangerous organization after her sister goes missing.\n\n

        One of the main weaknesses of "Dokumushi" is its convoluted and confusing storytelling. The manga jumps back and forth between different timelines and perspectives, making it difficult for the reader to follow the story and understand what is happening. The pacing is also inconsistent, with some chapters feeling rushed while others drag on unnecessarily.\n\n

        Another issue with "Dokumushi" is its lack of compelling characters. Rui, the protagonist, is often passive and reactive, with little agency or personality of her own. The supporting characters are similarly underdeveloped, with little backstory or motivation to make them interesting or engaging.\n\n

        The artwork in "Dokumushi" is also lackluster. Todas style is simplistic and unremarkable, with little attention paid to detail or composition. The character designs are generic and unmemorable, and the action sequences are often confusing and poorly choreographed.\n\n

        Overall, "Dokumushi" is a disappointing manga series that fails to deliver a compelling story or memorable characters. The convoluted and confusing storytelling, lack of interesting characters, and unremarkable artwork all contribute to a forgettable and unenjoyable reading experience.

The depictions of the various alien creatures and their gruesome violence are both shocking and awe-inspiring.

        Additionally, "Gantz" features a diverse and well-developed cast of characters. Each character has their own unique backstory, personality, and motivations. As the story progresses, the characters are given ample opportunities to grow and evolve, making their eventual fates all the more impactful.\n\n

        Overall, "Gantz" is an excellent manga series that delivers a compelling and mature story alongside stunning artwork.

        The artwork in "Monkey Peak" is also noteworthy. Kumetas style is highly detailed and realistic, with a focus on texture and shading. The character designs are distinctive and expressive, and the monkeys are drawn in a way that is both terrifying and eerily realistic.
        However, it should be noted that "Monkey Peak" is a mature and at times gruesome manga, with themes and scenes that may be too intense or violent for some readers. The manga contains depictions of graphic violence and gore, which may be disturbing or offensive to some readers.\n\n
